<H1>Readseq: Read &amp; reformat biosequences
.. <a href="/cgi-bin/readseq.cgi">web service</a>
</H1>

Readseq was written originally around 1989 a component of a
sequence analysis program, but when I added a small,
simple command-line interface, it took on a life of its own as a
conversion program for bioinformatics. It's main contribution to
bioinformatics is it takes on the job of guessing what your input
biosequence data format is, and converting it to what your
software knows how to handle.

See here <a href="readseq-help.html">readseq-help.html</a> 
and <a href="Readseq2-help.html">Readseq2-help.html</a> for extended help.

<p>
What you need to use it is 
<ol>
<li><a href="readseq.jar">readseq.jar</a> the java archive of this program.
	(<B><I>don't</I> unpack this jar</B> on your computer).
	
<li>a Java runtime system on your computer, versions 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5.

<li>for OLD MacOS 9-, take also <a href="ReadseqApp.hqx">ReadseqApp</a>, 
  a small Mac application to run readseq without a command line
  (B>do un-binhex and un-stuffit</B> this one).
	
</ol>

<p> 
This version includes a <B>Graphic User Interface (GUI)</B> for those who
prefer not to learn the many command line options, or who's
workstation lacks a command-line interface (which probably
includes most but the hardy bioinformaticians :).
Double-click the readseq.jar file to launch or Run as <br>
<ol>
<B>java -jar readseq.jar</B> <br>
</ol>
If you do like command line interfaces, see the docs, the brief doc is
<ol>
<B>java -cp readseq.jar help</B> <br>
<B>java -cp readseq.jar run</B> -- for command-line <br>
<B>java -cp readseq.jar app</B> -- for GUI application <br>
<B>java -cp readseq.jar cgi</B> -- for web CGI app<br>
</ol>

<p>
This version includes a <B>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</B> for use from a 
web server.  One web server where you can find this is
<a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/readseq.cgi">IUBio Archive</a>.
See the extended help for details and installing your own readseq web cgi, 
or see readseq.jsp for web JSP.
<p>

This version also includes the same old <B>Command Line Interface (CLI)</B>
that the 1992 version supported, so you can drop it in place of the
older, slower, bugger, less functional Readseq from that decade.

<p>
Programmers will find the <B>source code</B> here also, in
<a href="readseq-source.zip">readseq-source.zip</a>,
with JavaDoc generated documents in <a href="readseq-javadocs.zip">readseq-javadocs.zip</a>.
<br>
You will find a nearly identical source version bundled with other
iubio java source. This is split into
java 1.3/javac-compatible source code 
(one public class/file, file name == public class name)
at this folder,
<br>
<a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/java/source/">
http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/java/source/ </a>
as iubio-javalib.tar.gz
<br>
with expectation in summer 2002 this will become
reference readseq source.

Home of this package is <a

<p>
Anyone can use Readseq. There are no copyright restrictions,
it is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.
