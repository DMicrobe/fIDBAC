readseq-2.1.30 updates:
  enabled -nofeature= behaviour to act correctly to remove feature locations
from others.  Now requires both -feature=xxx and -nofeature=yyy options.
For example, this removes coding sequences from a source GenBank record:
 java -jar readseq.jar -format=fasta -pipe -nofeature=CDS -feature=source genbank-sequence.gb

Prior to this -nofeature= acted same as -feature= option.
