rseq.mcp is the CodeWarrior project file to recompile readseq source.
See http://www.metrowerks.com/ for this multi-platform (macos, mswin,
solaris, linux) java/... development tool.

rseq.mcp.xml is a text dump of the project for those w/o codewarrior.

Be advised that readseq java source will not recompile with sun's
JavaC simple minded compiler, as it does not comform to the constraint
of that compiler that each public interface or class must be in
a folder/file of the same name.
